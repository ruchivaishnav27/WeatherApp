# What's the Weather?

## Description

This website provides a traveler with a five-day weather forecast of any city in the world.  This website was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs.  I had a challenge specifically in getting the API to work.  In the future, I would like to provide the traveller with an hourly forecast of each day.
